The song talks about longing for the past, reminiscing about a lost love, and being unable to escape the memories. The singers reflect on the happiness and love they once shared, recognizing that it's over but cherishing the memories. To continue conveying this sentiment in the lyrics, the songwriter could focus on vivid imagery or sensory details that evoke nostalgia, such as specific scents, sounds, or feelings associated with the past relationship. They could also explore the conflicting emotions of wanting to move on but being unable to let go completely.
